## Why a blog?

As a developer, we often tend to only show the final result: the code, the deployed project, the performance. But there is a whole process behind it, failures, discoveries, and also a life outside the terminal.

Fun fact: I initially considered naming this space **Z-Library**, but for those who know... that name is definitely already taken. So, I went with **The Z-Files** instead!

I wanted to create this space to share:

- My **technical discoveries** (because we learn every day).
- My **personal projects** (those that don't necessarily end up in production).
- My **thoughts** on tech and the world around it.
- And maybe some **extra-professional passions**.

## The Tech Stack

This blog is powered by:

- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **MDX** (to write rich content simply)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)

It's a lightweight, performant solution that allows me to keep control over all the code. No heavy CMS, just Markdown files that I can edit in VS Code.

## What's next?

I plan to publish regularly (or not, no pressure!) on what I'm doing. Stay tuned, whether via the graphical interface or the terminal!
